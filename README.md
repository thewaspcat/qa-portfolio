# QA Portfolio – created by Marta Czarnecka



This repository contains my **QA portfolio**, demonstrating both my knowledge in **manual test case design** and my skills in test **automation with Python, Pytest,** and **Playwright**.  

The software under test is a **mock e-commerce website**: [automationexercise.com](https://www.automationexercise.com/).
