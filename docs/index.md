# QA Portfolio by Marta Czarnecka <br>

---

Welcome to my **Quality Assurance portfolio**, which showcases my knowledge about manual software testing as well as my experience in test automation.


This portfolio demonstrates:
- Methodical approach to structuring test cases
- Compliance with the official international requirements for software testing documentation <br> (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3) and ISTQBÂ® standards, **enhanced** with details for automation readiness
- 1:1 mapping between manual test cases and automated test scripts for maximum traceability.
- Industry-standard practices for test design, test execution and test maintainance.

The software under test is a mock e-commerce website: [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/) .
