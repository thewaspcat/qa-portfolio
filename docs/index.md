# QA Portfolio â€“ Marta Czarnecka

Welcome to my **Quality Assurance portfolio**, which showcases my skills in both manual test case design and test automation in Python.


This portfolio demonstrates:
- Methodical test case structures (Jira-style documentation, enhanced with details for automation readiness)
- Automated test scripts aligned with manual test cases for traceability.
- Industry-standard practices for test design, execution and maintainability.
