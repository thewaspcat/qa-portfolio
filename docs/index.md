# QA Portfolio by Marta Czarnecka

Welcome to my **Quality Assurance portfolio**, which showcases my knowledge about manual software testing as well as my experience in test automation.


This portfolio demonstrates:
- Methodical approach to structuring test cases
- Compliance with the official international requirements for software testing documentation (ISO/IEC 29119/ISTQB), **enhanced** with details for automation readiness)
- Full alignment between manual test cases and automated test scripts for maximum traceability.
- Industry-standard practices for test design, test execution and test maintainance.
