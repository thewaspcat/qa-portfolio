# QA Portfolio by Marta Czarnecka <br>

---

Welcome to my **Quality Assurance portfolio**, which showcases my skills in manual software testing of frontend and backend components - with **UI and CRUD (REST API)** test cases as selected deliverables — as well as my experience in test automation and defect reporting.  
All manual test cases, including Postman-aligned API tests, are structurally Jira/Xray-ready — they can be easily imported or linked to Jira work items in Xray.

This portfolio demonstrates:
- Methodical approach to structuring test cases;
- Compliance with the official international requirements for software testing documentation <br> (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3) and ISTQB® standards, **enhanced** with details for automation readiness;
- 1:1 mapping between manual test cases and automated test scripts for maximum traceability;
- Industry-standard practices for test design, test automation, bug reporting and manual REST API testing (CRUD operations).

The software under test is a public demo e-commerce website: [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/) .

## Manual Test Cases:


### Frontend (Web UI):

- [Homepage UI Layout and Components Display](manual/TC_UI_HOME_001.md)
 
- [Login Page Functionality – Valid Credentials](manual/TC_UI_LOGIN_001.md)
  
- [Homepage Navigation Menu Functionality](manual/TC_UI_NAV_001.md)

### Backend (REST API):

These are CRUD-focused API test cases for manual test execution in Postman against the public Automation Exercise API (positive behavior verification).

- [GET All Products List](crud/TC_API_CRUD_001.md)
  
- [POST to All Products List](crud/TC_API_CRUD_002.md)
 
- [PUT to All Brands List](crud/TC_API_CRUD_003.md)
 
- [DELETE User Account](crud/TC_API_CRUD_004.md)
